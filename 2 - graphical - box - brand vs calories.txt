All manufacturers produce cereals with a median of approximately 100 calories. 

Cereals manufactured by General Mills do not contain similar amounts of calories as observed due to the outliers but are rather quite dispersed from one another. 

Kellogs produces an outlier as well as extreme points in terms of calories. 

Calories found in cereals produced by Post have their upper quartile equal to the maximum. This is represented by the lack of a whisker. The same can be seen for Quaker Oats. 

Raiston's calories are skewed to the right whereas Nabisco's, Post's, Quaker Oats' and Kellogs' are to left.
